- Runtime behavioral tests
- benchmark tests
  - factorial
  - List access time
  - Try mandlebrot?
  - class instantiation
  - basic arithmitic operations
  - calling bound methods on instances
  - calling super methods.
  - class declarations.
- reduce how much cloning going around in the interpreter
  - when identifiers to primitive types and literals are evaled
    the values are copies, let's not do that since it creates
    unnecessary overhead on binary operations
  - only a copy a primitive type on assignment.
  - do we have to pass functions by value? (thinking binding).
- break down RDParser
- break down the interpreter further
- try to lose recursion from the environment get_at and set_at
  probably causes an excessive overhead to accessing identifiers.
